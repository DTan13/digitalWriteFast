# Notes

Notes down the observations, experiences and occorances during the development of the repo.

Useful for explaining certain decisions.


###### speed of digitalWriteFast:

On Arduino Uno clone, 16MHz

digitalWriteFast is so fast that 

```C++
void loop() {
  digitalWriteFast(pinNum, HIGH);
  digitalWriteFast(pinNum, LOW);
}
```

The above did not result in 50% duty cycle. (see Graph1.png)

Rather, the pin stays low for quite some time until the program loops again. 

Took around 600ns for the program to repeat


So, the below was done instead:

```C++
void loop() {
  digitalWriteFast(pinNum, HIGH);
  digitalWriteFast(pinNum, LOW);
  digitalWriteFast(pinNum, HIGH);
  digitalWriteFast(pinNum, LOW);
//	...  and it goes on, multiple times
  digitalWriteFast(pinNum, HIGH);
  digitalWriteFast(pinNum, LOW);
  digitalWriteFast(pinNum, HIGH);
  digitalWriteFast(pinNum, LOW);
}
```

It only took 250ns to toggle, meaning it took only 250ns/2= 125ns to set or clear the pin/port.
